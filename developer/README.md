#Developer Install

At this time only Ubuntu 18.04 is supported

In a terminal window, clone the repository for installation only.

## Run:

* sudo apt update; sudo apt -y install git

* git clone https://github.com/Duke-MatSci/nanomine.git

* cd nanomine

* git checkout phase1

* cd developer

* bash ./ubuntu-install-initial.sh # to start the installer

Only the first phase is available so far....

# This is a work in progress, so YMMV...
